## Missions

At its core a mission is a way of structuring your players interactions with the game. You can create a simple linear sequence of activities for a player to do or complex choice driven quests.

Missions are the most powerful component available to you in a game. They make it possible to create complex and flexible player journeys. The way you use missions depends on the type of gamified system you wish to make.

There are several benefits you can reap from well defined missions within a game:

* Sketching out the player journey as a mission forces us to think through the actual player experience. We can put ourselves in the player's shoes, and that helps us design better experiences.
* Missions enable you to change the player experience and see the impact immediately in the game.
* Breaking down an activity into many short steps enables the player to receive feedback on each step. This increases the probability of a player making it through the entire mission especially if its long.
* Missions make it easy for us to find out which step of a activity causes people to get stuck or give up. We can then use that insight to improve the player experience.
* Finally missions enable you to create external games much faster. Playlyfe takes care of all the complex state transitions and player progress tracking.

### Use Cases

Missions are great when you need to create things like skill trees. In the context of an online education platform, good skill trees encourage players to learn and allow them to build their own skill set as per their interests. The mission of guidance can be very easily tweaked and tested with Playlyfe.

With features such as Lanes and Escalations, missions work well for role based activities too. In an organization, missions are generally well defined and often involve people with different roles, which makes missions in playlyfe a natrual fit.
