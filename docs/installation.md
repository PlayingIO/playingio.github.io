title: Installation
---

**Prerequisite**: either NPM (comes with [node](https://nodejs.org/en/)) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/).

If you'd like to install Playing I/O platform globally, do:

```sh
npm install -g playingio
```

This gives you a few globally exposed commands you can run, described later. But usually, you'd install the project locally:

```sh
npm install --save-dev playingio
```
