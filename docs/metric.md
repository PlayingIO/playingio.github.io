## Metrics

Metrics are used to measure the performance of the players in your game, of teams, and even of your whole game. Normally, you'd setup your metrics to capture and quantify a specific behaviour of your players, so that you can later assess how well your players are being driven. There are four kinds of metrics PlayingIO offers you. These are:

### Point Metrics

> The simplest form of metrics, they are found in most games. They are just a numerical value which increases/decreases when players perform actions. They are used to keep track of player progress.

Points can be given to a player by performing an action, a task in a process or by executing custom rules.

Point metrics can be used to create leaderboards. You can also model level systems by combining a point metric and a state metric in a level rule.

#### Use Cases

Point metrics are ideal to capture any kind of progress or for keeping track of any activity.

### Set Metrics

> A set metric is a group of unordered items.

While designing set metrics, you need to define preset items.

### Use Cases

There are several ways you can use sets.

* You can use set items as badges to represent a player's progress in various aspects of your game.
* You can use set items as tags or inventory items on a player.
* You can combine set items with achievement rules to make player achievements.
