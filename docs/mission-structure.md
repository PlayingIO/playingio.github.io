title: Mission Structure
---

There are two parts to a mission:

* the design, which we call the definition of the mission, and
* the instance, which is created by the players when they are in the game

Both the definition and the instance have very separate structures. The definition structure is as follows:


## Mission Definition Structure

The design structure is what is used when you are making the mission.

|    Field    |    Description    |
|-------------|-------------------|
| id          | A unique ID for the mission. |
| name        | A name for the mission. |
| description | A brief description of the mission. |
| image       | An image which represents the mission. |
| settings    | Settings for the whole mission. See below Settings section for details. |
| lanes       | Lanes can be used to retrict players to a particular task/tasks. Each lane has a structure described in the Lane Structure section below |
| id          | A unique ID for the mission. |
