## Creating a Game

We call all gamified systems a Game on Playing I/O. This does not mean that they are the sort of games you play everyday like Angry Birds or Candy Crush Saga.

A Game on Playing I/O is a system of missions, teams, metrics and rules which come together to engage a player in an experience. The experience could be anything from visiting a website to doing work in your office.

Playing I/O acts as the game engine behind these systems. It takes care of all the hard stuff like tracking scores, team structures, player progress and maintaining real-time leaderboards.

## Types of Games

Playing I/O supports two types of games:

* **External** An external game can take many forms. It could be a simple website with a gamified loyalty program. It could even be a completely customized gamification product for a particular problem domain. Eg: Fitness workout gamification. External games need a dedicated development team to create the user experience for the game from scratch. Hence, they tend to be more expensive to develop and maintain than native games.
* **Native** A native game is an automatically generated application hosted at http://games.Playing I/O.com/your-game-id. You can theme it to reflect the unique style of your game. Currently, Playing I/O models the user experience as a simple tracker application. This is useful is many scenarios where the actual player experience takes place in the real world itself. Eg: volunteer activities in NGOs.

## Components of a Game

Now that you've created your game on Playing I/O, let's have a look at the different components of a Game. There are 4 main components to every game on Playing I/O:

Metrics

Metrics are what you measure within a game. They are used to track player performance and behaviors. Eg: Points, Badges, Achievement, etc.

Actions

Actions are the most basic way of capturing player actions and can be used to capture simple player events such as liking a post or finishing a quiz.

Missions

Missions allow the game designer to structure the player journey. You can use missions to control the order in which players can perform the tasks available to him.

Missions can model common activities on a site like answering questions, voting, sharing, etc. They can also model more complex choice driven story based quests and challenges.

Teams

Teams define a subset of players within your game and can be easily used to model teams within your organization.

Rules

Rules state conditions which when fulfilled by a player affect the player in some way. You can use them to award achievements and level up players when they get a certain amount of points.

Leaderboards

You can use leaderboards to drive competitive behaviours within a game. Our leaderboards come with a ton of features that take you to the next level. Oh wait, did I forget, all leaderboards update in real time!
