# Why Should I Use PlayingIO Platform

PlayingIO aims to empower people to use gamification as an effective strategic tool. It does this by breaking down the technical barriers that often hinder the adoption of gamification.

PlayingIO allows you to go from a game design on paper to a completely functional app in a matter of minutes. It gives you immense flexibility and power to design, prototype and revise your game design over time.

Leadership and management teams can use PlayingIO to create effective gamified solutions. Development teams can use PlayingIO to create or extend their own gamified solutions.

# Creating a Game

We call all gamified systems a Game on PlayingIO. This does not mean that they are the sort of games you play everyday like Angry Birds or Candy Crush Saga.

A Game on PlayingIO is a system of processes, teams, metrics and rules which come together to engage a player in an experience. The experience could be anything from visiting a website to doing work in your office.

PlayingIO acts as the game engine behind these systems. It takes care of all the hard stuff like tracking scores, team structures, player progress and maintaining real-time leaderboards.

# Types of Games

PlayingIO supports two types of games:

* **External** An external game can take many forms. It could be a simple website with a gamified loyalty program. It could even be a completely customized gamification product for a particular problem domain. Eg: Fitness workout gamification. External games need a dedicated development team to create the user experience for the game from scratch. Hence, they tend to be more expensive to develop and maintain than native games.
* **Native** A native game is an automatically generated application hosted at http://games.playingio.com/your-game-id. You can theme it to reflect the unique style of your game. Currently, PlayingIO models the user experience as a simple tracker application. This is useful is many scenarios where the actual player experience takes place in the real world itself. Eg: volunteer activities in NGOs.
