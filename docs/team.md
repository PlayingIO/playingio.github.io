## Teams

Teams let you organize your players into meaningful groups. These groups are what are called roles within the team. which can then be assigned separate roles to perform different tasks in a game.

In games there are several types of players. Some players have certain access and privileges which others do not.

In business scenarios, this is often a reflection of how we structure the organization itself.

In the case of a web community it could be reflection of how we organize the community into moderators and admins.

Whatever the case maybe, Playlyfe allows you to model the power relations between your players using teams. Within each team you can create a hierarchy of roles, assign permissions and control who can create an start a team, who can join and who can leave.

### Use Cases

With teams we can very easily recreate an organizational or community like hierarchy. This makes modeling of the game a much more simpler process.

Take an example of a classroom, here we have just 2 roles - teacher and students. If we have actions for taking a class, attending a class, writing a test and so on, we can model and restrict these actions based on the role of players in the team.

This is a fairly trivial use case, but can be very easily extended to more complex and relevant real life use cases.
