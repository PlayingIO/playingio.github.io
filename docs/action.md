## Actions

> Actions are an easy way of capturing events on the playlyfe platform.

Actions are basic triggers that allow you to translate player events/actions into a measurable entities on playlyfe.

An action has 3 parts:

* **Rewards** - Rewards are a set of scores and conditions where the scores are given to a player if he satisfies the given conditions.
* **Variables** - Variables that can be passed in during runtime and can be used in conditions for rewards or in rewards themselves.
* **Visibility** Requirements - By default, all actions are visible to all players. By using visibility requirements, you can restrict access to actions to only those players who satisfy a given criteria.

### Use Cases

Any task done by a person can be easily recorded in playlyfe by using Actions. For example, an action could be going to the gym, reading a book, liking a facebook post or answering a quiz.

An action can be used pretty much anywhere. In case of an online education platform, action could be watching a tutorial video, which would fetch a player some experience points that can be used to show the person their progress within the course. Similarly, answering questions or posting on forums can also be actions that contribute to their progress or rating.
